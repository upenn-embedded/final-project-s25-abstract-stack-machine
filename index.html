      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>We all learned a lot from this project, including how best to debug hardware both through print statements and probing.  We also learned how best to handle many different parts working together, especially since we had to figure out how to best handle 6 different ADC devices with only one ADC interrupt.  A couple of aspects of our project went well.  Firstly, the buzzer effectively works each time the pressure sensor is tapped, and the BPM calculation is consistently correct.  Furthermore, the screen does a good job of consistently displaying the BPM and the current note being played.  Lastly, having multiple ADC devices working at the same time was a concern, but that was always consistently working as well.  One accomplishment we are particularly proud of is getting the gyroscope to work.  It took a lot of debugging on our end, but it was really cool to see the gyroscope so effectively be able to switch the notes just be turning our hand over.  We never had to change our entire approach, but for the gyroscope, we did change what it did.  Previously, we said it would change the volume of the music.  However, the sound board we were using was not very effective at changing the volume of the audio noticeably enough so we ended up using the gyroscope to add a full scale of notes.  In the end, we actually preferred this approach because it allowed us to have a wider range of songs we can play on the instrument.  One major obstacle we encountered that we did not anticipate was that when we soldered, since everything was so delicate, the soldering was not quite enough to make the project work all of the time, so we had to do a lot of debugging with the connections to make it work completely.  This caused a lot of problems, and if we could go back we would instead spend more time soldering all of the connections strongly the first time so that we did not have to go back and fix so many of them later.  Another unanticipated obstacle that we encountered was that the buzzer was not working because we used Timer3 on the Atmega for the buzzer and we did not realize that UART also uses Timer3.  Because of this, we spent a lot of time debugging it since we were trying to use UART for debugging at the same time as playing the timer, but eventually we realized our mistake and stopped using UART while using the buzzer.  Some next steps for this project would be to secure the connections better through better soldering, make a wider range of notes with better usage of the gyroscope (perhaps it could change octaves completely), and change the buzzer so that it uses an additional sound board to sound more like a drum.</p>
